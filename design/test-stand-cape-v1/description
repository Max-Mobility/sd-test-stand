This folder contains the EAGLE .sch/.brd files used to create the first version of the SmartDrive Test Stand cape. This cape is designed to mount with a 4D LCD display adapter cape onto a BeagleBone Black.

Features:
5V Power Regulation to supply BeagleBone Black, 4D LCD display, and on cape circuitry
1 Low-side (n-channel MOSFET) coil driver for use with a solenoid
1 Low-side (n-channel MOSFET) coil driver with current sense circuit for use with Magnetic Particle Brake
1 5V Quadrature Encoder feedback circuit with A,B, and I signals.

Known Issues:
-Encoder logic voltage is low because of only passive use of pullup resistors and voltage divider resistors. Still acceptable level, but minimal.
